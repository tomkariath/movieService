Create a simple Movie Feedback Collection System based on micro-service architecture. With this application an administrator should be able to add create movie list and visitors will be able to add feedback about the movie. Feel free to assume any functional requirements/attributes needed while implementing the solution. We expect the application to be exposed via REST endpoints exposed.

Summary of Functional requirements are given below: • Administrator should be able to create movie list • Visitors should be able to add feedback to the movie list

Few non-functional requirements are • There should be sufficient test coverage (unit / integration tests) and code quality/security checks. • Service(s) should be observable, it should have sufficient logs and metrics • Service(s) should be containerized and deploy-able to Kubernetes • Automate all stages within a CI/CD pipeline

Nice to have: • UI is optional but nice if you can create something quickly

Expected Artifacts: • Architecture diagram and sequence diagram • Code along with unit and integration test case • Docker File • Kubernetes manifest • Pipeline Script
